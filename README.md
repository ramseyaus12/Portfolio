### Project 1: Deep Steer 2

For the Deep Steer 2 project, a mixture was used of machine vision, machine learning and artificial intelligence based on popular pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks to autonomously steer a vehicle.  The team developed and tested this approach on the LTU (Lawrence Technological University) ACTor (Autonomous Camus TranspORt) vehicle - an autonomous vehicle development and research platform. The Deep Steer 2 project is a continuation on the previous research project Deep Steer 1, with changes to the neural network architecture by adding two more layers.

### Project 2: Housing Market Price Prediction

For this project a dataset was found on Kaggle published by Harish Kumardatalab. The goal of this project was to accurately predict future housing market prices based off of several features including price, area, bedrooms, bathrooms, stories, main road, guestroom, basement, hot water heating, air conditioning, parking, prefarea, and furnishing status.
