## Projects

### Course Work

This directory contains projects completed through course work. There is a variety of models used throughout the projects.

### Project 1: Deep Steer 2

For the Deep Steer 2 project, a mixture was used of machine vision, machine learning and artificial intelligence based on popular pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks to autonomously steer a vehicle.  The team developed and tested this approach on the LTU (Lawrence Technological University) ACTor (Autonomous Camus TranspORt) vehicle - an autonomous vehicle development and research platform. The Deep Steer 2 project is a continuation on the previous research project Deep Steer 1, with changes to the neural network architecture by adding two more layers.

### Project 2: Housing Market Price Prediction

For this project a dataset was found on Kaggle published by Harish Kumardatalab. The goal of this project was to accurately predict future housing market prices based off of several features including price, area, bedrooms, bathrooms, stories, main road, guestroom, basement, hot water heating, air conditioning, parking, prefarea, and furnishing status.

### Project 3: Basic React JS App

For this project a basic React JS app was designed and developed. The goal of this project was to provide a simple shopping list with functionalities including adding to the list, checking boxes for items in the list, deleting items in the list, and persistant saving of items when the web app is reloaded to prevent loss of data.

### Project 4: Titanic Problem

For this project a dataset was found on Kaggle that contained a list of all people who were aboard the titanic and data relevent to them and the sinking of the ship. The goal of this project was to accurately predict which persons were most likely to survive the devastating crash and compare to the actual persons who survived. Several machine learning models were used and compared including logistic regression, random forests, support vector machines, and gradient boosting.
