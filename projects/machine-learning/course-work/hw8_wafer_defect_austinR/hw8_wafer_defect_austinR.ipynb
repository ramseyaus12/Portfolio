Instead I decided to use only the 3rd model as you can see in the code all the code for the 1st and 2nd models has been commented out. The number of epochs used initially was 60, which resulted in accuracy starting around 45% but took far too long to train. I used the MAE history graph and the validation accuracy and loss graphs to determine the range of epochs I needed to use, which ended up around 10 resulting in 80%+ accuracy. The graphs for training and validation accuracy and loss can be seen above, as well as the mean test accuracy of 89.13%. Initially I had used another pre-trained network called VGG19 but the total training for all three pre-trained models was too extensive as well, to mitigate training for too long I created a custom cnn model. As well I had to try different batch sizes, data augmentation, and target sizes to get optimal results that didn't take hours to train."]}],"metadata":{"accelerator":"GPU","colab":{"provenance":[]},"gpuClass":"standard","kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.8.10"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
